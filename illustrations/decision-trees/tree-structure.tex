\caption{
        Rendering of a decision tree structure. Each inner node corresponds to a partitioning of the examples of the parent edge. In standard decision trees, this is a binary partition, that is, the examples are 	extit{split} at a certain value threshold in a certain feature dimension. The splitting function can be understood as a classifier and indeed extensions have been proposed to construct oblique (non-axis-aligned) splits or use more sophisticated classifiers instead.
        TODO: attribute source; maybe have colours match the decision boundaries in other plot.
