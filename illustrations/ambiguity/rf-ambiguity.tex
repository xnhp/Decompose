\caption{The spread of individual tree predictions in a random forest ensemble. 
    Glyphs correspond to test errors of individual trees. 
    The dashed line is the average test error of individual \tcircle{green} trees 
    $\frac{1}{M} \sum_1^M \ell(y, q_i)$.
    The solid line is the test error of the ensemble
    $\ell(y, \bar{q})$. 
    The difference between these values is the \textit{ensemble improvement} or \textit{ambiguity-effect}.    }
