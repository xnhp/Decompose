# this could be a start, however we actually want to compare the error rates of the trees
# and not the ratio of incorrect trees in the ensemble

You are correct, the current implementation uses the prediction of the random forest ensemble, not the individual trees, to calculate the number of errors made by each tree for each test example. To calculate the number of errors made by each tree, we need to iterate through each tree in the ensemble and compare its predictions with the true labels for each test example.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, n_features=10, n_redundant=0, n_informative=2,
                           n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=1)

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest ensemble with 12 trees
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=12, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Determine the ratio of trees that incorrectly classified each test example
error_ratios = []
for i, tree in enumerate(rf.estimators_):
    y_pred = tree.predict(X_test)
    num_errors = np.sum(y_pred != y_test, axis=1)
    error_ratio = num_errors / len(y_test)
    error_ratios.append(error_ratio)

# Plot the error ratios
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.bar(range(len(error_ratios)), error_ratios)
plt.xlabel("Test Example Index")
plt.ylabel("Error Ratio")
plt.title("Error Ratios for Each Test Example")
plt.show()
```
In this corrected implementation, we iterate through each tree in the ensemble using the `for` loop, and for each tree, we predict the labels for the test examples using the `predict` method of the tree. We then calculate the number of errors made by each tree using the `np.sum` function, and store the result in the `error_ratios` list. Finally, we plot the error ratios using the `matplotlib` library.
